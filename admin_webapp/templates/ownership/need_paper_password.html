<h1>Claim Ownership: Enter Paper ID and Password</h1>

<div>
  By entering the paper ID and <i>paper password</i> associated with a
  paper, you can become registered as the <i>owner</i> of a paper.
  Being the owner of a paper confers a number of benefits: for
  example, you can make changes to the paper, cross-list the paper and
  add a journal reference.
</div>
<div>
  If you register as an author of a paper, we can provide you with a
  list of all the papers you have authored.  Additionally, if you are
  registered as the author of enough papers in a subject area, you can
  endorse other people to submit papers to that subject area.
